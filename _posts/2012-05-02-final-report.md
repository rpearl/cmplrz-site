title: Final Report
author: Ryan Pearl and Michael Sullivan

Since our final paper includes many charts, code listings, and math listings,
we did not bother to translate it to a web format. Therefore, we have made
available the PDF version of [our final
report](http://www.endofunctor.org/~cmplrz/paper.pdf "Range Analysis for the
IonMonkey JavaScript Compiler") available.

Our code is open source, and is available on
[github](https://github.com/rpearl/ionmonkey-range-analysis/). We plan to land
our code in the [IonMonkey tree](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ionmonkey/ "IonMonkey project").
The tracking bug for range analysis is [Bug
699883](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699883 "Range Analysis
tracking bug") in Mozilla's bug tracker.
